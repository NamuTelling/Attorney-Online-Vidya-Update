REMEMBER TO DO THIS BEFORE MERGING THE FILES.

If you don't trust the bat, please remove the following folders, all found in the characters folder.

- Ryunsouke Witness
- Brisbane
- Lewdton
- Delia Karmann
- Apollo_Counsel

Also, rename the "[999] Investigation.mp3" to "[999] Investigation (Middle).mp3", found on the music folder.
And rename the character folder called "JudgeDGS" to "Judge GB", don't worry about the ini, if you do this correctly, and apply these changes before merging, then everything should be good.
