[This was found attached to a receipt from an old antique dealer. It appears to have been attached by mistake.]

Five days did it take,
Nothing was done in it's wake
For here, it came down

On it's cry, the town,
One of beings called "Dangits"
And the new "Ooosee"

Here, it would have died
But, for the river of life
It was no challenge

Yet in my old age
I have but one thing to say
"Fuck off, dear Verin"

[When questioned about it, the Antique Dealer screamed at the investigator, and we have not seen him since.]
