The following was the last recorded interaction between an unknown individual and the woman before her discovery inside of a broom closet.

"Certainly not, kind sir! I am here but to clean your courtroom."

"Is that all you have come here for, little one? My courtroom?"

"I have no idea what it is you imply, master. I am but a poor juror."

"So you are, my dumpling. And a good one at that. Such missing legs and shapely forehead."

"You embarrass me, your honor!"

"Fear not. You are safe here with me."

"I must finish my cleaning, sir. The courts will have my head if I do not!"

"Cleaning, eh? I have something for you. Here. Polish my gavel."
