In the middle of a court session, a police officer sprang up, and shouted out the following:

"Dear gods, what in the name of our Good Queen is this? Some farce? That fellow over there - he doesn't even look like Sherlock Holmes! He's a fake, a phoney! Some man claiming to be the good detective! And what's this about this... "AT-MEE-MEE" technology? I've never heard of such a brand - why is this man testifying as if everybody has? And finally, the defense AND prosecution, where do I even begin? Both of them - idiots who know nothing about the law.

And you, Judge. Don't think I've forgotten about you, much like you have forgotten about this tria--"

[Upon the end of the end, the man was dragged away by the bailiff. As it turns out, the man that they had thought to have been Bale Eiff was actually none other than Sherlock Holmes. Currently, the man who deemed himself "God Holmes", according to the Court Record, is on the run for impersonation of a public figure.]
