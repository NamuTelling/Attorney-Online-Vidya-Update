Case No. #C4NSJ4
============================
A woman was found cowering in the corner of a small lobby room. This woman claims to have been supposedly stuck inside a broom closet. However, this was not the case. She was simply neglected and forgotten and had signs of severe blurriness and quality. 

Furthermore, the woman kept mumbling to herself about some young maid that everyone was also supposedly clamouring for. When prompted about the maid, she started becoming increasingly aggressive and upset, and soon after, started shouting that "fucking bloody gits are just gonna fucking play with the bloody maid and not even care about me" and so on so forth. Shortly after, she started threatening to stab us with makeup or something. She stormed off to go look for the maid.

End of report.
