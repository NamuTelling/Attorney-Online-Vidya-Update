Birdman v2.1!!!!
We redid all of his sprites so he looks more accurate to the show. His face has been tweaked and his undershirt is now a light yellow instead of white.

Now with 11 emotions:
-Normal
-Disgusted look
-Holding a piece of paper
-Holding a coffee cup
-OBJECTION!
-Mole
-Pointing up
-Laugh
-Sad
-Damaged/Shocked
-Zoom (not updated)
Added the Harvey Birdman theme with vocals
His "Take That" now has him say "I'll take the case!" and his "Hold It" now has him say "Wonder what that means?"
We also gave him new images on his select screen
He also has brand new buttons! Thanks button guy!

To come...maybe?:
-Voiceline for his "Hold It" (still trying to find one even remotely close to it)
-Desk slam
-More useless sidegags
-Various little fixes to existing sprites


-Dr.Blank and Guardly

It's pretty much functional though

8 positions:

To come:
-Desk slam
-Holding the paper (Maybe Avenger brings it? Depends on how hard he's to draw)

-Various little fixes to existing sprites

Feel free to post ideas and feedback in the general anytime, I always got it open
