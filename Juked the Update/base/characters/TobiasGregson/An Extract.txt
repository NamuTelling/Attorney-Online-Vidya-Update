As I came down the road, I came across a clue that puzzled both me and Holmes. When I first approached him about the subject, he gave his usual irritating laugh, and called me an idiot. Well, blast him, if he doesn't want cases, then he shouldn't insult me.

"It's simple, Inspector", said he, lighting his pipe as he leaned back into his chair. I raised my eyebrows in response. "Considering the location, and the con--", I started, before I was interrupted by another bark of laughter. "This "clue", Inspector, is none other than some simple graffiti that a man whom he thought was quite clever made", he said, stiffling a laugh as he attempted to keep a straight face, "you can see other instances of it all over town". I stood, silent for a few seconds, and then bowed my hat. It had not been a clue, but just a simple piece of illegal drawing.

I will never live that day down, and the words "DOUGHDRAGONSMADETHIS" still haunt me to this day.
